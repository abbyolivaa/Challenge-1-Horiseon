# Horiseon

## Description
This project exercises the addition and use of semantic HTML elements, structured and organized code, alt attributes with images, headings in sequential order.

Change the <title> from "website" to "Horiseon"

Change the <div class: header> to <header>
    In CSS: make sure to change all ".header" selectors to "header" now that it is no longer a class selector

Change the <div> with the unordered list below the <h1> to <nav>
    In CSS: Change the "div" on lines 25, 27, and 29 to "nav"

Since the <div> element is not a semantic element, we will replace all div tags to <section> tags.

In the "content" <section>,
* Add an id before the "search-engine-optimization" class
* In the same section, add alt attributes after all the <img src=...> Write a quick description of the <image>

In the "benefits" <section>, change the <section> tag to <aside>

Change the <section class="footer"> tag to <footer>

Lastly we will go back to the top of the code and add line breaks to each main section to make our HTML code look less cramped and more organized. We will also go back and make sure that our indents are at the correct spot and that all our tags are closed with the matching opening tag
